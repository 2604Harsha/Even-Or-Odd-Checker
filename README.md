# 🧮 Odd and Even Number Checker

## 📘 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that checks whether a number entered by the user is **Odd** or **Even**.  
The program uses basic Python concepts such as:
- Variables  
- Input and Output  
- Operators (`%` modulus operator)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Takes multiple number inputs from the user.
- Displays whether each number is **Odd** or **Even**.
- Helps beginners understand conditional logic and operators.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- **Variables** – to store user input  
- **Operators** – `%` modulus operator to check divisibility by 2  
- **If-Else Statements** – to determine odd/even logic  
- **Input Function** – to accept numbers from the user
